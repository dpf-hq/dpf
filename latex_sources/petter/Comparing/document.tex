\section{Henshin}

Henshin provides a model transformation language for the Eclipse Modelling
Framework \cite{Steinberg:2009:EEM:1197540}. With support for both direct 
transformation of EMF single model instances, and translation from source
model to targeted model. The Henshin project is a transformation language with a
provided graphical syntax. With the help of this graphical editor, it provides
the user with an intuitive way of representing rules. The tool also has support 
both endogenous and exogenous transformations.

\subsection{Defining transformation rules}

In Henshin, objects are referred to as nodes and links between objects as edges.
A collection of these nodes and edges form a graph. Each rule is represented as
a graph in the graphical editor.
