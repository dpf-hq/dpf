@inproceedings{INSPEC:606170,
abstract = {The paper presents an algebraic theory of graph grammars using homomorphisms and pushout constructions to specify embeddings and direct derivations constructively. It considers the case of arbitrary directed graphs permitting loops and parallel edges and having labels on vertices and edges. The gluing of two arbitrary labeled graphs (push-out) is defined allowing a strictly symmetric definition of direct derivations and the embedding of derivations into a common frame. A two-dimensional hierarchy of graph-grammars is given including the classical case of Chomsky-grammars and several other graph-grammar constructions as special types. The use of well-known categorical constructions and results allows simplification of the proofs and a pregnant formulation of concepts like `parallel composition' and `translation of grammars'},

@article{France2007,
abstract = {The term Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is typically used to describe software development approaches in which abstract models of software systems are created and systematically transformed to concrete implementations. In this paper we give an overview of current research in MDE and discuss some of the major challenges that must be tackled in order to realize the MDE vision of software development. We argue that full realizations of the MDE vision may not be possible in the near to medium-term primarily because of the wicked problems involved. On the other hand, attempting to realize the vision will provide insights that can be used to significantly reduce the gap between evolving software complexity and the technologies used to manage complexity.},
