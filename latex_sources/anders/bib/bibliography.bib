  abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the designscience paradigm knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis o f the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community}

  abstractNote={The Generic Modeling Environment (GME) is a con- figurable toolset that supports the easy creation of domain-specific modeling and program synthesis environments. The primarily graphical, domain-specific models can represent the application and its environment including hardware resources, and their relationship. The models are then used to automatically synthesize the application and/or generate inputs to COTS analysis tools. In addition to traditional signal processing problems, we have applied this approach to tool integration and structurally adaptive systems among other domains. This paper describes the GME toolset and compares it to other similar approaches. A case study is also presented that illustrates the core concepts through an example.}, booktitle={Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing Budapest Hungary}, publisher={ACM Press},
